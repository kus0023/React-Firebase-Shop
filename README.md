This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Follow the step to get this project

## 1. Fetching Project

make dir of any name where you want your project and then run this to fetch the data from github

> make sure that path is correct in cmd (use cd)

```
git clone https://github.com/kus0023/React-Firebase-Shop.git

```

## 2. Setup Firebase

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

> You need to setup sign methods in authentication and enable Realtime database.
> **_Recommended time (2.33 to 3.20) then (17.43 to 18.05)_**
> [Watch this to Setting Things in Firebase](https://youtu.be/PZquB8XdU9k)
> **Also enable Google and Facebook if You want to use it as well**

### copy configuration code and paste it into firebase-config/fire.js

## 3. Run Command

`npm install`

> This takes some time wait until its done

## 4. Hurray You Are Ready To Go

hit this command to run the server:
`npm start`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
